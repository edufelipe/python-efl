    Smart Evas Objects.

    Smart objects are user-defined Evas components, often used to group
    multiple basic elements, associate an object with a clip and deal with
    them as an unit. See evas documentation for more details.

    Recommended use is to create an B{clipper} object and clip every other
    member to it, then you can have all your other members to be always
    visible and implement L{hide()}, L{show()}, L{color_set()}, L{clip_set()}
    and L{clip_unset()} to just affect the B{clipper}. See
    L{ClippedSmartObject}.

    B{Pay attention that just creating an object within the SmartObject
    doesn't make it a member!} You must do L{member_add()} or use one of
    the provided factories to ensure that. Failing to do so will leave
    created objects on different layer and no stacking will be done for you.

    Behavior is defined by defining the following methods:
     - L{delete()}: called in order to remove object from canvas and
       deallocate its resources. Usually you delete object's children here.
       I{Default implementation delete all registered children.}
     - L{move()}: called in order to move object to given position. Usually
       you move children here. I{Default implementation calculates offset
       and move registered children by it.}
     - L{resize()}: called in order to resize object. I{No default
       implementation.}
     - L{show()}: called in order to show the given element. Usually you
       call the same function on children. I{No default implementation.}
     - L{hide()}: called in order to hide the given element. Usually you
       call the same function on children. I{No default implementation.}
     - L{color_set()}: called in order to change object color. I{No default
       implementation.}
     - L{clip_set()}: called in order to limit object's visible area.
       I{No default implementation.}
     - L{clip_unset()}: called in order to unlimit object's visible area.
       I{No default implementation.}
     - L{calculate()}: called before object is used for rendering and it is
       marked as dirty/changed with L{changed()}. I{Default implementation
       does nothing.}
     - L{member_add()}: called when children is added to object. I{Default
       implementation does nothing.}
     - L{member_del()}: called when children is removed from object.
       I{Default implementation does nothing.}

    @note: You should never instantiate the SmartObject base class directly,
       but inherit and implement methods, then instantiate this new subclass.
    @note: If you redefine object's __init__(), you MUST call your parent!
       Failing to do so will result in objects that just work from
       Python and not from C, for instance, adding your object to Edje
       swallow that clips or set color it will not behave as expected.
    @note: Do not call your parent on methods you want to replace the behavior
       instead of extending it. For example, some methods have default
       implementation, you may want to remove and replace it with something
       else.
